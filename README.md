## Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm install`            | Installs dependencies                                                                                          |
| `pnpm dev`                | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`                                                                    |
| `pnpm build`              | Build your production site to `./dist/`                                                                        |
| `pnpm build:noindex`      | Same `pnpm build` but adds `robots.txt` to disallow search engine crawling. Useful for Netlify branch deploys. |

| `pnpm astro ...`          | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check`                                                               |
| `pnpm astro -- --help`    | Get help using the Astro CLI                                                                                   |
