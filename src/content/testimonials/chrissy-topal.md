Sascha is a first-class developer. His social skills made the collaboration in the team very pleasant. Together we worked on the relaunch of the jobvalley website. With his expertise, we created a very modern and clean codebase that is fun to work in. If I could put together a dev team in the future, Sascha would definitely be part of it.
