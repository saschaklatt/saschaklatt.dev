title: Front-end Web Development

Want to build a composable website, a data-heavy web app, or something in between? With years of front-end development expertise, I can create engaging, robust user experiences across all modern browsers and devices. I create component libraries, ensure smooth animations, adherence to accessibility guidelines, and provide load time improvements, on-site SEO, automated testing, multi-language support, third-party API integrations, user tracking, A/B testing, and Core Web Vitals optimization.
