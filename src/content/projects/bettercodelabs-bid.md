Commissioned by bettercodeLABS to enhance the UI of their existing prototype into a production-ready design, I utilized Figma to create a user-centric design prioritizing simplicity and functionality. Through wireframing and prototyping, I developed a clickable prototype in Figma for desktop and mobile devices, ensuring an intuitive interface. The implementation of the design into the client application involved React.js and Material UI for a polished and consistent look. Real-time updates were seamlessly integrated via a REST API, elevating user engagement and responsiveness. The result is an optimized UI that enhances the overall bidding experience.
