The web application go.fluege.de efficiently sifts through thousands of airlines to give users the best flight options at unbeatable prices. In this project, I had the chance to work with Invia Flights' front-end team to modernize the existing platform. We made use of technologies such as Web Components, Polymer, Lit, and Redux and integrated the booking forms with a complex REST-based microservice architecture.
