This platform serves as a unique hub for teachers to share resources on political education. My task was to develop the front-end and design a RESTful API using Swagger to create a seamless interface to our custom CMS. Using React and Gatsby as foundational tools, we ensured exceptionally fast loading speeds due to Gatsby's static page generation and advanced image optimization.",
